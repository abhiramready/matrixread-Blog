## matrixread 3.0

📅 Released on May 2021  
🎨 Migrated from default WordPress theme to [Neve theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/neve/) and custom CSS for clean UI  

⬇️ Decreased WordPress plugin count from 20 to 10 = Performance ++  
Re-use existing plugins for maximum functionality with the help of some custom config and scripts, a higher plugin count can cause bottlenecks in a WordPress instance so the fewer the plugins the better.  

💭 Migrated WordPress Comment System to [💎giscus](https://giscus.app/) powered by GitHub Discussions  
It uses a GitHub login, which is perfect for a dev blog. It is open source, has no spam/ads/tracking, and has no database required. 
I have also customized it to load on matrixread on demand, visit [giscus.app](https://giscus.app/) to know more.
