| 🎨 Migrated from default WordPress theme to [Neve](https://wordpress.org/themes/neve/) and custom CSS for clean UI |
| ⬇️ Decreased WordPress plugin count from 20 to 10 = Performance ++                                                       |
| Re-use existing plugins for maximum functionality with some custom scripts and config, a higher plugin count can cause bottlenecks and poor performance in a WordPress instance so the fewer the plugins the better. |
| 💭 Migrated WordPress Comment System to [💎giscus](https://giscus.app/) powered by GitHub Discussions, uses a GitHub login, perfect for a dev blog, open source, and no spam/ads/tracking/database required.        |
